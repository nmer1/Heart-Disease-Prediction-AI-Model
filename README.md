# Heart Disease Prediction Project

In this project, I used different machine learning models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest to predict heart disease. After trying several models, **Logistic Regression** gave the best accuracy of **88%**.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file to train the model and evaluate it.

Feel free to check out the code and improve it!
